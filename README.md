## About this bot
This is a telegram game bot where the players tell the bot how far they want to walk, and the bot will find a random interest spot for the player to find! The bot will give the player hot and cold hints, which the player may want to use in order to get to the location.

## api
the api folder contains all the APIs that we use besides our main telegram one

    # google_maps uses the googlemaps api to fetch location data based on latitude and longitude

## handlers
the handlers are our personal modules, each handler is in charge of something else

    # command_handler is in charge of all the commands such as "/start"

    # database_handler is in charge of how we store and fetch user_data, bot_data and chat_data.

    # keyboard handler is in charge of handing keyboard related actions and callbacks.

    # message_handler is in charge of any user input that isn't a commant, it can be anything from text to location or video

    # state_handler is in charge of the state machine
